Implementation of TensorFlow Fast GAN Neural Style Transfer 

A generative adversarial approach for style transfer. Style transfer has focused mostly on transferring the style of one image (e.g. painting) to another image (e.g, a photograph). The style transfer is done in real-time from a pretrained model based on: https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/arbitrary_image_stylization  ,  with arbitrary style images. This approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is done by translating an image from one context (e.g. photograph) to another (e.g. Van Gogh painting/self portrait).

Definition of GAN: A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.
